# Pong Game

## About The Project/Features

An old school/classic paddle game.
In this project we learn how the canvas can be animated. Initially it is in the loop and the computer doesnt start until you do. Once you move your mouse over the paddle, the game begins and cursor is hidden. The score is kept and updated automatically on the left. Everytime, you or the computer wins, the ball resets in the center.The winning score by default is 7 points. Once the game is finished, the winner is annnounced and the button to 'Start Again' is displayed.
